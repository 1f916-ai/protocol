// REGRESSION: Merkle halving above 2^32 (protocol issue #5).
//
// verify.mjs halves tree indices with `Math.floor(n / 2)`. The tempting
// "optimization" is `n >> 1`, and it is correct for every tree this registry
// has ever had. JavaScript's bitwise operators coerce to int32 first, so at
// n >= 2^31 the shift returns a wrong (often negative) value and every proof
// above that size silently mis-verifies. isSize() admits any safe integer, so
// nothing else in the file stops a caller from reaching that range.
//
// The failure is invisible in normal operation: the identity log is five
// leaves and would stay correct under the broken version for years. That is
// exactly why it needs a permanent test rather than a comment.
//
// These cases build REAL RFC 6962 proofs at sizes above 2^32. The expected
// roots are computed here by an independent implementation of the same
// walk, so this file never asks verify.mjs to confirm its own arithmetic:
// if the two disagree the case fails, whichever one is wrong.
