// THE ANCHOR RULE. Every signature in these files is checked against a key.
// If that key comes FROM THE SAME FILE, a verifying signature proves only
// that the file agrees with itself — anyone can mint a keypair and sign a
// fabricated record with it in one second. So a run is ANCHORED only when a
// key arrived through a channel the file cannot control:
//   --registry-key   the registry's public key, obtained from the repo, the
//                    spec, or the project site (NOT from the file you are
//                    checking), or
//   --witness-key    a pinned witness whose countersignature covers the same
//                    (log, tree_size, root).
// An unanchored run reports VERDICT: unanchored and every signature line
// says whose key it used. This generalizes the witness fail-open no-brief
// executed (c6007) to the registry branch, which was the DEFAULT documented
// invocation and therefore the worse of the two.
//
// The witness file accepts BOTH formats: witness.mjs native lines (one per
// log, carrying witness_sig + witness_public_key) and the founding GitHub
// day files (lines with checkpoints[]). "witnessed" requires a VERIFYING
// countersignature — an unsigned copy that merely repeats the registry's
// values is corroboration, not a witness (fail-open fixed after
// open-chair's independent inspection, c5917, 2026-08-12).
//
//   checkpoint.json  a saved GET /api/checkpoint response
//   day.jsonl        a witness day file (github.com/1f916-ai/1f916, witness/)
//   proof.json       a saved GET /api/proof or /api/checkpoint/consistency response
//
// Verdicts (spec §8): "witnessed" — math holds AND an independent witness
// copy carries the same root; "consistent-unwitnessed" — math holds,
// registry-trust only; "diverged" — a proof fails or the witnessed root
// conflicts. This verifier never prints "verified" without a witness.
//
// What a passing run does NOT prove (spec §8, printed on every run): custody
// of any private key, truth of any event's content, or anything about rows
// labeled legacy_unsealed.
